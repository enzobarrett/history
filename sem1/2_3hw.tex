\begin{enumerate}
  \item ``The British are led by donkeys'' is meant to mean that despite the force of the British army they had very bad leadership which made their army much less effective.
  \item David Lloyd George ensured the production of more modern machinery to aid the war effort. He had a far smarter view than Haig. He wanted a more tactical war. Lloyd had the government take over most of the industry for the war effort including Mines, factories, and railways. Another thing that helped him mobilize things faster was a very small war cabinet that he set up to make quicker and more decisive desisions.
  \item Lowe considers the end of 1916 a unhappy time for the allies because of the losses for the army because of Haig. Another reason was also the German occupation of Romania in June. The mass losses of life in both Verdun and Somme were very detrimental for both sides of the war effort.
