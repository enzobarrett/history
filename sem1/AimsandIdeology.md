# Fascist beliefs in 1919

#### Shifting Ideology
  * In 1919 Mussolini set up a Fascio di Combattimento in Milan
  * Leaders began to be known as `Fascists of the First Hour`
  * Their Fascist Programme was a yearly news source focus on holding together right and left wing politics and appealing to as large of an audience as possible 
  * This group consisted of five different ideals and beliefs
    1. National Syndicalism 
    1. Technocratic fascism: Accepting industrial rev and modernism
    1. Rural fascism: anti-urban, anti-modern, anti-industrial 
    1. Conservative fascism: Favoring tradition, and the Catholic Church
    1. National fascism: Aggressive territorial expansion
  * Mussolini began to become more right wing after 1919
  * He cut the enemy list down to Socialists and the communist revolution

#### Mussolini's Socialism vs actual socialism

  * It differed ideologically because it was largely composed of anti-clerical republicanism. Syndicalism and anarchism were far less important aspects of his ideology. 
  * Unlike many of his socialist peers, instead of condemning war Mussolini encouraged it, as he thought it would be the catalyst for socialist change Italy needed.
  * His flavour of socialism also varied from the norm because instead of class struggle, he was far more focused on extreme nationalism
