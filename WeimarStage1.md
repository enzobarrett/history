## Stage 1

* Surrender was necessary in 1918 even though army officials claimed otherwise Germany was very weak
* An acceptance of a `democratic state` would get less punishment from the Allies, a strategic move not a dedication to democracy
* Since the democratic revolution in Germany was not started from the ground up it had an unstable foundation. It did not have public support and the very people that promoted the creation promoted it's demise. It was linked by the public to the weakness of Germany and the treaty of Versailles (1919)
* Even though Germany took many hits from the `Treaty of Versailles` it did not completely destroy them
