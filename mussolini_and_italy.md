# Mussolini Coming to Power

#### Main Reasons

  * Unhappiness with treaty of Versailles, leading to d'Annunzio's removal from Fiume
  * This led to an anti-government view by the people
  * Economic effects because of the war: 
    1. Lots of borrowed money from the US gov
    1. The value of the lira declined vastly
    1. Cost of living increased 3x
    1. Mass unemployment
  * Growing dislike of of parliamentary system: proportional representation introduced 1919 made it so  that with 9 parties nothing got done in the gov
   
#### Mussolini's Socialism vs actual socialism

  * It differed ideologically because it was largely composed of anti-clerical republicanism. Syndicalism and anarchism were far less important aspects of his ideology. 
  * Unlike many of his socialist peers, instead of condemning war Mussolini encouraged it, as he thought it would be the catalyst for socialist change Italy needed.
  * His flavour of socialism also varied from the norm because instead of class struggle, he was far more focused on extreme nationalism
